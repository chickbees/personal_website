Just some notes of some ideas so I don't forget

Website sections:
1. Eye-catching introduction page
2. About
3. Skills/work/education
4. Projecs
5. Contact

Will need a navigation bar with the below sections:
1. Home
2. About
3. Resume
4. Projects
5. Contact

Still deciding if it will be a floating navigation bar, fixed, etc

The website instead of a scrolling action, should be transition to the next section.
These sections should be full page size. The scrollbar should be removed and maybe changed with some
highlighting of the section either on the navigation bar, some dots on the side, or both. Will also
most likely need to implement some sort of footer at the bottom so it's not empty.
